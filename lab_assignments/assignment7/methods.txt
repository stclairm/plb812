1. Download genome 

Downloaded locally from NCBI, used scp to upload to cluster.

2. Download SRA SRR492407 

module load SRA-Toolkit/2.10.7-centos_linux64

prefetch SRR492407

3. Convert sra to fastq 

fastq-dump --split-files SRR492407.sra

4. FASTQC 

Use run_fastqc.sh script - main command is fastqc ${file_list}

There were obvious quality issues (per base sequence quality declined 
significantly as position in read increased). No adapters were detected, 
but I decided to include the Illumina universal adapter sequence in my 
cutadapt command in case there is adapter contamination at a low 
concentration. I also added a flag (-q 25) to my cutadapt command to trim 
bases with phred scores lower than 25. 

5. Trim reads with phred score < 25 

cutadapt -q 25 -a AGATCGGAAGAG -o SRR492407_1_CA.fastq SRR492407_1.fastq
cutadapt -q 25 -a AGATCGGAAGAG -o SRR492407_2_CA.fastq SRR492407_2.fastq

6. FASTQC2 

Used run_fastqc.sh script again.

Cutadapt improved quality - per base sequence quality is now more consistent
across the read. 

7. Index genome with bwa 

module load GCC/5.4.0-2.26  OpenMPI/1.10.3
module load BWA/0.7.17
module load bwa-mem2/2.0

bwa index ref.fa

8. Align 

bwa mem ref.fa SRR492407_1_CA.fastq SRR492407_2_CA.fastq > SRR492407_aln_pe.sam

9. SAM to BAM

module load SAMtools/1.15

samtools sort -o SRR492407_aln_pe.bam SRR492407_aln_pe.sam

10. Mapping statistics

samtools flagstat SRR492407_aln_pe.bam
