To download fastqc, I used the following command:

conda install -c bioconda fastqc

To run fastqc I used the shell script, run_fastqc.sh 
(provided in this repository)

sbatch run_fastqc.sh 
(run in directory with fastq files and where you want fastqc html files output to)

I used Globus file manager to move all of the html files from the working
directory to plb812/lab_assignments/assignment2 (easier for me to use a 
file manager with a GUI to move files around and make sure there are no 
unnecessary duplicates)
