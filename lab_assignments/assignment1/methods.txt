1. Genome

Brachypodium distachyon (stiff brome)

RefSeq assembly accession: GCA_000005505.3 

The reference paper (Lenk et al.) stated the reference genome used could be found on Phytozome. I created a Phytozome account and looked for it,
but could not find the version the authors used anywhere but NCBI. I used the following command to download the genome to the cluster:

wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/005/505/GCF_000005505.3_Brachypodium_distachyon_v3.0/
GCF_000005505.3_Brachypodium_distachyon_v3.0_genomic.fna.gz

Since the file was compressed, I used gunzip to uncompress it:

gunzip GCF_000005505.3_Brachypodium_distachyon_v3.0_genomic.fna.gz

The genome downloaded as a .fna file, which I searched and found that it stands for "fasta nucleic acid," meaning the file was still in fasta format.
I changed the name to include the proper file extension using the basic Unix command 'cp'



To get the annotation file, I clicked "Download assembly" on the same NCBI page for the genome, but chose the GFF file format. This downloaded the 
annotation file to my local drive, but I uploaded it to the cluster with the following command:

scp /Users/mallorystclair/Downloads/genome_assemblies_genome_gff.tar stmallor@hpcc.msu.edu:/mnt/home/stmallor

After uploading to the cluster, I noticed the file extension for the annotations was gff.tar instead of gff, so I used the following command:

tar -xf genome_assemblies_genome_gff.tar

This file was uncompressed and did not require using the 'gunzip' command.

2. RNAseq data

The authors listed Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE126992 as the source for their RNAseq data. I searched this accession number on
GEO, scrolled to the bottom of the page to where it said "Samples (45)," and clicked '+More..."
I scrolled through the list of samples, and when I came across one that included "t1-control" or "t1-treated," I clicked on the GSM number to the left
of it. This took me to another web page with info about the individual sample. I scrolled to the bottom of this webpage to the section titled 
"Relations," and clicked on the SRX number. This took me to a third webpage, which still had information about the sample. Once on this third page, 
I scrolled to the bottom to find the SRR number. I copied this number and used prefetch to download all of the sra files to the cluster: 

prefetch SRR8618217

The accessions I downloaded were:
SRR8618217
SRR8618218
SRR8618219
SRR8618220
SRR8618221
SRR8618222
SRR8618232
SRR8618233
SRR8618234
SRR8618235
SRR8618236
SRR8618237
SRR8618247
SRR8618248
SRR8618249
SRR8618250
SRR8618251
SRR8618252

I used fastq-dump to convert the sra files to fastq files and zip them.

fastq-dump --split-files --gzip SRR8618217.sra

The screenshot in this repository shows the first 10 lines of the uncompressed fasta file for the reference genome. Another is included to show that
the SRA files are currently being converted to fastq format and zipped. I will upload a final screenshot of the first 10 lines of one of the fastq 
files, and another screenshot showing the entire list of fastq files once these jobs are complete.
