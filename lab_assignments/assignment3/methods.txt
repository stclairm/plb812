The FastQC reports generated from the previous lab assignment showed no adapter content (0% for all types).
However, it's possible that adapter sequences are still included in the data, just in low concentrations (compared to actual reads), 
so I used cutadapt to trim Illumina TruSeq 3 adapters from my reads:

cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA -o SRRXXXXXXX_1_CA.fastq SRRXXXXXXX_1.fastq
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT -o SRRXXXXXXX_2_CA.fastq SRRXXXXXXX_2.fastq 

I then used fastqc to re-run quality control tests on all the reads:

fastqc ${file_list}
